## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Liza. 

Right now, Iâ€™m diving into Git as part of my traineeship at Yandex. Who else is enjoying practicing here?

## joyful activity
I love Irish dance. I have been practicing Irish dance for many years, with breaks. Additionally, I do yoga every morning to prepare for the day.

## plans
I adore traveling through Asia! Thereâ€™s something so exciting about visiting new places and seeing how locals live their everyday lives. Iâ€™ve explored a handful of countries there but haven't yet made it to Europe, which is on my list.

## ðŸŒ± improvement
Moreover, I have been attempting to learn the Georgian language for about a year. Although I can read it, my vocabulary remains limited, and I often find myself delaying further progress.
